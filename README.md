## Project description

The task of writing a mini - game was set as a test task when applying for a job.

The task:
It is required to develop a mini-game "bouncing ball".
From right to left, various obstacles in the form of rectangles move.
There is a ball in the center of the screen, with which you can jump over obstacles.
If the ball hits an obstacle, the game is over. If the level is passed - the end of the game.

Implement the code in pure JS with execution on the client side without using additional libraries and frameworks.
Everything can be done both in one html file or in several - everything is at your discretion (style.css and pictures to improve the appearance - optional)
