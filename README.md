# BOUNCING BALL

## Description

The task of writing a mini - game was set as a test task when applying for a job.

The task:

It is required to develop a mini-game "bouncing ball".
From right to left, various obstacles in the form of rectangles move.
There is a ball in the center of the screen, with which you can jump over obstacles.
If the ball hits an obstacle, the game is over. If the level is passed - the end of the game.

Implement the code in pure JS with execution on the client side without using additional libraries and frameworks.
Everything can be done both in one html file or in several - everything is at your discretion.

## Functional

- There are two game modes:
  * Arcade - where the user independently chooses how many obstacles he wants to overcome to the finish;
  * Infinity is a mode where there will be an infinite number of barriers, a game for points;

- The ball jumps 3 heights (little, middle, high);
- All points are calculated and stored in Local Storage;
- The number of points scored is shown in a separate window during the game;
- In case of victory, defeat or a new record, the user is notified of this;

## P.S.

The game is currently under development. 
A lot of functionality will still be added to it and an adaptation for mobile devices will be made. 

This project is created purely for fun :)
